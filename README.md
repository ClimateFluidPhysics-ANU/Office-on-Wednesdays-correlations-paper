# At the office on Wednesdays and Andy @ home: correlations

This repository includes datasets and notebooks for the manuscript "CFP group members at the 
office on Wednesdays and the relationship with Andy staying at home: correlations and causality".


## Claim - Motivation

[@navidcy](https://github.com/navidcy) has been claiming for long that because Andy does not come in at the office on
Wednesdays the CFP in-present attendance at the office is dramatically reduced. [@AndyHoggANU](https://github.com/AndyHoggANU)
claims that this is just natural variability.

## Purpose of repo

Here we will be gathering data for in-office attendance both for Wednesdays and for other days.
The hope is that we can proceed doing proper statistical analyses and significance tests on the
data to determine whether or not this effect is *real* and also whether it is part of natural
variability.
